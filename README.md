# pyhtonReactApp

## Description

This is a small app to practice Python and DB skills.

I followed this tutorial:

In order to run the backend, use the following commands:

```
$ cd my-project
$ source venv/bin/activate
```

This will activate your virtual environment.

For running the DB, use SQLite and import the db.sqlite3 file.

To run de frontend simply:

```
$ cd my-project
$ cd my-app
$ npm start
```
